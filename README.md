# AttendX — React (single-file App.jsx)

This project was auto-converted from your standalone HTML+Babel file into a Vite + React app with TailwindCSS.
It keeps the UI classes and custom CSS. The JSX logic has been placed into `src/App.jsx`.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- All CDN React/ReactDOM/Babel references were removed.
- The render/mount is handled by `src/main.jsx`.
- Your original CSS variables & utility classes are preserved in `src/index.css`.
- If you had a `ReactDOM.render(...)` call, it was removed during conversion.
